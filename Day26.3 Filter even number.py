# ......................Instructions......................
# In this list comprehension exercise you will practice using list comprehension to filter out the even numbers from a series of numbers.

# First, use list comprehension to convert the list_of_strings to a list of integers.

# Then use list comprehension again to create a new list called result. This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list numbers.

# Again, try to use Python's List Comprehension instead of a Loop.

# Example Input
# 9, 0, 32, 8, 2, 8, 64, 29, 42, 99
# Example Output
# [0, 32, 8, 2, 8, 64, 42]

# ......................Solution........................
list_of_strings = input().split(",")
# 🚨 Do  not change the code above

# TODO: Use list comprehension to convert the strings to integers 👇:
int_list = [int(num) for num in list_of_strings]

# TODO: Use list comprehension to filter out the odd numbers
# and store the even numbers in a list called "result"

result = [number for number in int_list if number % 2 == 0]
# Write your code 👆 above:
print(result)
